I am a 5th year Mechanical Engineering PhD Candidate at Stanford University working with Dr. Allison Okamura and Dr. Sean Follmer in the [CHARM](http://charm.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [SHAPE](https://shape.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} Labs. My work applies human-centered design and robotics to design appropriate rehabiliative and assistive technology for people with a stroke with motor disabilities, particularly those who are medically underserved.

I hold a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a MS from Stanford University. My PhD has been funded by the National Sciene Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program, Stanford Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research on Racial Equity and Justice Seed Grant, Stanford Impact Labs Design Fellowship, and the NSF Convergence Accelerator.
